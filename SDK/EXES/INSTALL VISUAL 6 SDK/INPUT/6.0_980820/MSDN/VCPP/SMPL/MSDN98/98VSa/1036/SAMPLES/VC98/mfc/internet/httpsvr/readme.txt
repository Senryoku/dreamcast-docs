HttpSvr Installation and Tips
=============================

HttpSvr is an MFC sample web server application. It operates as a
single-document interface application, configured with an HttpSvr
Configuration file (.HSC). You create HSC files by selecting "Save"
from the "Server" menu. The application registers the HSC files with
the system so that double-clicking on an HSC file will start HttpSvr.
Multiple instances of HttpSvr can be running at any time, but only
one can be listening on any particular port (80 being the default).

Setup Instructions
==================
Step 1: Build the HttpSvr.exe project.
Step 2: Create a root HTTP directory named "WebPages" in the root
		folder of the same drive as the executable (see below).
Step 3: Copy the folder "SvrAdmin" and all it's contents into the
		root HTTP folder.
Step 4: Run the copy of HttpSvr.exe on your hard drive.

Your are now ready to serve up your web pages. Keep in mind that if
you make any changes to the default configuration, you'll have to
save those settings into an HttpSvr Configuration file (.HSC) via the
"Save" item on the "Server" menu, and launch future HttpSvr sessions
from the resulting .HSC file in order to re-use those settings.


Root HTTP Folder
================

By default, the server will attempt to serve-up files from the folder
"WebPages" on the same drive as the executable. When you first run
HttpSvr, if that folder does not exist, it will ask you if you want
to create it. You do not have to use that folder; you can specify
another. Just remember that a different root folder is a change in
configuration and should be saved as a new HttpSvr Configuration file
(.HSC).

It is highly recommended that you copy the SvrAdmin subfolder from the
source directory to this folder so that the directory listing icons
can be used by your server when a default document file is not
available. For example, I put my root at C:\WebPages, and the tree
looks something like:
	C:\
	  WebPages\
		 SvrAdmin\
		 RonLo\
		 Cmd95\
		 HttpSvr\
Everything in and under "WebPages" will be available for viewing over
the web (as long as the hidden attribute is not set).
***Don't forget to copy "SvrAdmin"!!***

Tips
====

Unless you want people to be able to browse all the files in a
directory FTP-like, include an HTML file named "default.html" that
will get loaded automatically. HttpSvr is smart enough to look for
default files with names like default.html, default.htm, index.html
and index.htm.

If you do want people to be able to browse (like if you have a
directory of files that can be downloaded), files with the "hidden"
attribute set will not be available for download but will still be
listed. If the SvrAdmin folder was not installed as a subfolder of
your main root HTTP directory, directory listings will be quite ugly
due to the server not finding the icons that should be there.

The most important directory to have a default.html file is the root
HTTP folder.  This is the one people type in when they're not sure of
any specific page names.  For example, my server's name is "RonLo."
When someone types a URL of "http://RonLo" or just "RonLo", the
default.html file in the root HTTP file gets loaded, and it tells
them what all is on my server.

If none of the default HTML files are present, it will look for a CGI
app named (you gessed it) default.exe. If it finds one, it will run
it as a GET operation without any parameters.
